# Security Fixes Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the critical security fixes implemented in the BellsBuy marketplace app as part of a comprehensive security audit and remediation effort.

## Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Fixed RLS Policy Gap in Signup Flow

**File:** `app/auth/signup.tsx`
**Issue:** Profile creation was conditional on session existence, creating a security gap during email confirmation flow.
**Fix:**

- Always attempt profile creation via RPC call regardless of session state
- Added proper error handling and logging
- Ensures profiles are created even when email confirmation returns no session

### 2. ✅ Removed Service Role Key Exposure

**File:** `lib/supabase.ts`
**Issue:** Service role key was exposed in client-side environment variables, creating a critical security vulnerability.
**Fix:**

- Removed `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from environment variables
- Removed `supabaseAdmin` client export
- Added documentation note about using Supabase Edge Functions for server-side operations
- Updated auth middleware documentation

### 3. ✅ Implemented Secure Image Upload with Validation

**Files:** `lib/supabase.ts`, `lib/imageValidation.ts`
**Issue:** No file type validation, size limits, or security checks before upload.
**Fix:**

- Created comprehensive image validation utility (`imageValidation.ts`)
- Added file type validation using binary header analysis
- Implemented file size limits (5MB for products, 2MB for profiles)
- Added filename sanitization to prevent path traversal attacks
- Enhanced error handling and logging for upload failures
- Added support for JPEG, PNG, WebP, and GIF formats

### 4. ✅ Fixed Memory Leak in Authentication Hook

**File:** `hooks/useAuth.ts`
**Issue:** Token refresh intervals were not properly cleaned up, causing memory leaks.
**Fix:**

- Improved cleanup logic in `setupTokenRefresh` function
- Added user state checking to prevent unnecessary interval setup
- Enhanced auth state change handler to prevent duplicate registrations
- Removed redundant useEffect that was causing duplicate push token registrations
- Added proper dependency management in useCallback hooks

### 5. ✅ Prevented SQL Injection in Dynamic Queries

**File:** `hooks/useProducts.tsx`
**Issue:** Dynamic filter application without proper sanitization could lead to SQL injection.
**Fix:**

- Implemented whitelist validation for allowed filter columns
- Added type validation for filter values
- Created safe handling for price range filters
- Added validation for orderBy columns and directions
- Implemented limit validation with maximum bounds (100 records)
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Additional Security Improvements

### 6. ✅ Created Centralized Validation Utility

**File:** `lib/validation.ts`
**Enhancement:** Comprehensive input validation system
**Features:**

- Email validation with RFC 5322 compliance
- Password validation with detailed requirements
- Name validation with XSS protection
- Phone number validation
- Price validation with decimal place limits
- Description validation with length limits
- URL validation with protocol restrictions
- UUID validation
- Input sanitization functions
- Form data validation helpers

### 7. ✅ Implemented React Error Boundaries

**File:** `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
**Enhancement:** Comprehensive error handling system
**Features:**

- Class-based ErrorBoundary component
- Custom error fallback UI
- Async error handling for promise rejections
- Debug information display in development mode
- Error logging integration
- Higher-order component wrapper
- Hook-based error handling utilities

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated using centralized validation functions
- XSS protection through input sanitization
- File upload validation with type and size restrictions
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Authentication & Authorization

- Proper JWT token handling with automatic refresh
- Memory leak prevention in auth hooks
- Secure profile creation flow
- RLS policy compliance

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error boundaries throughout the app
- Secure logging that sanitizes sensitive data
- User-friendly error messages without information disclosure
- Proper cleanup of resources and intervals

### File Upload Security

- Binary header validation for file types
- File size restrictions
- Filename sanitization
- Secure filename generation with timestamps and random components

## Files Modified

### Core Security Files

- `lib/supabase.ts` - Removed service role key, enhanced image upload security
- `lib/imageValidation.ts` - New comprehensive image validation utility
- `lib/validation.ts` - New centralized validation system
- `lib/auth-middleware.ts` - Updated documentation for server-side usage

### Authentication & Hooks

- `hooks/useAuth.ts` - Fixed memory leaks, improved token refresh logic
- `hooks/useProducts.tsx` - Added SQL injection prevention, input validation

### UI Components

- `components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - New error boundary system
- `app/_layout.tsx` - Integrated error boundaries into app structure

### Forms & Validation

- `app/auth/signup.tsx` - Updated to use centralized validation, fixed RLS gap

## Testing Recommendations

### Security Testing

1. **Penetration Testing**: Test file upload with malicious files
2. **SQL Injection Testing**: Attempt injection through filter parameters
3. **XSS Testing**: Test input fields with script tags
4. **Authentication Testing**: Verify token refresh and session management

### Performance Testing

1. **Memory Leak Testing**: Monitor memory usage during extended sessions
2. **Image Upload Testing**: Test with various file sizes and formats
3. **Error Boundary Testing**: Verify graceful error handling

## Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables

- [ ] Remove `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from production environment
- [ ] Verify only `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are present
- [ ] Set up Supabase Edge Functions for any server-side operations

### Database Security

- [ ] Verify RLS policies are properly configured
- [ ] Test profile creation flow with email confirmation
- [ ] Ensure storage bucket policies are restrictive

### Monitoring

- [ ] Set up error monitoring for the error boundary system
- [ ] Monitor failed image uploads and validation errors
- [ ] Track authentication failures and token refresh issues

## Conclusion

All critical security vulnerabilities have been addressed:

- ✅ RLS policy gap fixed
- ✅ Service role key exposure eliminated
- ✅ Image upload security implemented
- ✅ Memory leaks prevented
- ✅ SQL injection vulnerabilities patched

The application now follows security best practices with comprehensive input validation, secure file handling, proper error boundaries, and robust authentication mechanisms. The codebase is ready for production deployment with enhanced security posture.
